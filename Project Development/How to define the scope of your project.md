# Project Scope Preparation Guide

**Purpose:** Define a clear project scope that outlines what the project will achieve, the resources needed, the deliverables, and how to track progress.

---

### Step 1: Define the Core Objectives
Start by identifying the core objectives that your project must achieve. Ask yourself:

1. **What problem does the project solve?**
2. **Who is the target audience or end user?**
3. **What are the primary goals?** List 2-3 key outcomes.
4. **How will success be measured?** Define metrics or indicators.

> *Tip:* Keep these goals realistic and achievable.

### Step 2: Determine Key Deliverables
Define the specific results and deliverables. This will help set expectations on what will be created or provided.

1. **What specific outputs will the project deliver?** (e.g., reports, app features, models)
2. **How will each deliverable solve a user problem?**
3. **Is there a timeline for each deliverable?** Set a rough timeline if possible.

---

### Step 3: Outline the Scope Boundaries
Identify what is included in the project and what is **not** included to prevent scope creep.

1. **What will you focus on specifically?**
2. **Are there aspects that are out of scope?** (features or objectives to avoid)
3. **What limitations might impact the project?** (e.g., time, tech skills, budget)

---

### Step 4: Identify Resource Requirements
Ensure you know what resources you’ll need to succeed.

1. **What skills and tools are required?** List specific skills (coding, design) and tools (GitHub, databases, ORMs, libraries).
2. **Do you need specific hardware/software?** (e.g., cloud access, IDEs)
3. **Are there team members with specialized roles?** Define each member’s role briefly.

---

### Step 5: Define Risks and Challenges
Thinking ahead about potential risks will make you better prepared.

1. **What challenges might arise?** (e.g., tech limitations, dependency issues)
2. **How will you address these challenges?** Have backup strategies.
3. **What external factors could impact the project?** (like time constraints, dependencies on other teams, etc.)

---

### Step 6: Set a Clear Timeline
Establish a timeline to keep your project on track.

1. **What are the key milestones?** Define 3-4 checkpoints.
2. **How much time will each stage require?** Estimate based on past experience or research.
3. **Do you need any external approvals or reviews?** Factor in buffer time.

---

### Step 7: Develop a Communication Plan
Keeping everyone aligned is essential.

1. **How will you share updates with the Management?** Decide on a timeline.
2. **How frequently will updates be shared?** Set regular check-in points.
3. **Who is responsible for communication at each stage?** Assign this role. Preferably, keep rotating this, so everyone's contribution is equally seen.

### How to Use AI Tools Like ChatGPT to Enhance Your Project Scope

Using AI tools isn't wrong. But relying on them entirely during your learning stage definitely is. However, when used correctly, AI tools can incredibly speed up your repetitive tasks and provide you with good insight. They can be incredibly useful for planning, brainstorming, and refining your project idea. <br>
What you can ask ChatGPT -  <br>
1. **Brainstorming:** Use ChatGPT to generate creative ideas or approaches to your problem statement. For example, ask, “What are some unique features I could add to a resource management app?”
2. **Refining the Scope:** If you're unsure about your objectives or deliverables, ask ChatGPT to suggest questions to help you focus. For example, “What should I consider when setting objectives for a project about [your topic]?”
3. **Creating Timelines and Milestones:** Request assistance in developing timelines or identifying logical milestones. Try, “Help me create a basic timeline for developing a project with 3 main modules over 3 months.”
4. **Predicting Challenges:** ChatGPT can highlight common challenges based on your project type. Ask, “What are typical challenges in a project involving [technology or field]?”
5. **Resource Planning:** List out your project needs and ask ChatGPT for recommendations. “What resources and skills do I need for a project on [topic]?”

> *Tip:* Always double-check AI-generated suggestions with **reliable resources or mentors**.
